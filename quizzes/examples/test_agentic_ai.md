<Agentic AI Fundamentals>

What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes agentic AI systems from traditional AI?
- They use larger language models
> They can autonomously make decisions and take actions
- They require less training data
- They are faster at inference

Which component is essential for an agentic AI system to function?
> Goal-oriented decision making
- Human intervention at every step
- Static rule-based logic
- Pre-programmed responses only

What does the "agent" in agentic AI refer to?
- A human operator
- A database query system
> An autonomous entity that perceives and acts
- A specific programming language

In the context of agentic AI, what is a "tool"?
- A physical device
> An external capability the agent can invoke
- A debugging utility
- A machine learning algorithm

Which of the following are common capabilities of agentic AI systems? (Select all that apply)
> Planning multi-step actions
> Using external tools and APIs

<LLM Agents and Architectures>

What is the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern in LLM agents?
- A React.js framework for AI
> An approach where agents alternate between reasoning and taking actions
- A method for training neural networks
- A database architecture

Which of these is a key challenge in building reliable agentic systems?
- Lack of available LLMs
> Handling errors and edge cases autonomously
- Too much training data
- Excessive speed

What role does "memory" play in agentic AI systems?
> It allows agents to maintain context across interactions
- It stores the model weights
- It reduces computational requirements
- It encrypts user data

In a multi-agent system, what is "orchestration"?
- Training multiple models simultaneously
> Coordinating the actions of multiple AI agents
- Optimizing database queries
- Compressing model size

What is "prompt chaining" in the context of agentic AI?
> Breaking down complex tasks into sequential prompts
- Linking multiple users together
- A blockchain for AI models
- A data compression technique
